# 📧 Email Classification using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed during my **internship in Advanced AI and Deep Learning**. It focuses on building a lightweight **email classification system** using Python libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas**.

The classifier is designed for **real-time applications**, such as:
- Classifying emails as **spam** or **not spam**
- Detecting categories (e.g., promotions, updates, personal)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (optional, for ML models)
- NLTK or TextBlob (optional, for preprocessing)

## 🧠 Key Features

- Email preprocessing (removing HTML tags, punctuation, stopwords)
- Feature extraction (word counts, TF-IDF)
- Label encoding and data cleaning
- Training with basic machine learning models:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest (optional)
- Real-time classification simulation with sample email input
